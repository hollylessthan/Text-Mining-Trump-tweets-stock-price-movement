# Text-Mining-Trump-tweets-stock-price-movement

This is a project I created in the Text mining course at National Tsing Hua Universuty.
My purpose is to see how todays social media and news affect stock market movement.
I used tag clouds and line plots to analyze the relationship between Trump's tweet and stock prices.
Please refer to the .pdf file for more detail on my methodologies and the results.
